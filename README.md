This is a supplementary data for the paper titled "How graph neural network interatomic potentials extrapolate: Role of the message-passing algorithm".

Input files, training set, and trained models are provided.

Among the input settings, learning rates are adjusted during the training. So, using the input file itself may results in slightly different results with the paper.

The old and brandnew versions of SevenNet are both used, so please be careful with the trained models. The input files are identical.
